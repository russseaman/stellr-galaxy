# Galactic center

![Galactic center](Images/ge_vis_galactic_center.png)

The galactic center is similar to the [solar system](SolarSystem.md) as it is one chapter below the galaxy view. Essentially it is a galaxy POI that is an interactive scene. The scene is located in (*Assets/scenes/view_scenes/galactic_center_view_scene.unity*).

It is also similar as it uses the same orbital trails and object interaction as in the solar system. Hence please see the respective documentation for details on the basic interactions.
